    <h2>RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a web designer you need to know responsive design in order to build websites optimized for
       any kind of device. At the beginning, you should get familiar with CSS3 - the grid and flexbox systems. 
       After that, I recommend you to learn web design frameworks like bootstrap, foundation, materialize, pure etc.
       The most popular framework is Bootstrap created by Twitter.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning framework requires a time and dedication. Make sure you read its documentation
       before jumping into designing. If reading distracts you, a good way to learn is through watching tutorials
       on youtube or the platform like Udacity, which provide free courses.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive design can be really tough sometimes...Use google developer tools to change
       sizes of your screen and see how your layout looks alike while resizing browser. Many times, you will
       face moments when your design will have to be changed to fit into capabilities of a framework. DO IT
       - customize your design! You will face many difficulties, at the beginning of your way, since you
       won’t be able to manage complex designs. What you have to understand, is that learning framework
       takes time...Before you will be able to build great products - you have to start from building
       simpler designs.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Learn the parts separately. First - learn columns system well, second - learn navbar
       well, later - modals and so on…You will quickly notice, once you will become professional, that it is not
       completely possible to code the project you just scratched on the paper. You need to be aware that sometimes
       many changes must be made in order to fit your scratch into current tech capabilities of the framework or 
       design language.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frameworks and languages are evolving and we can do more and more with them which is 
       fantastic. However still, you should be aware of limitations. Don’t try to beat the limit and design your
       part of a language or framework, It will never work well. Remember about browsers capabilities! Most of the
       frameworks are customized to fit their requirements, and if you gonna come out with something new - it might
       just simply crush in the browser and you won’t be able to showcase your design.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In resume, in order to become a web designer you need to learn responsive design which
       includes: css3 language, flexbox, grid, frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation. It is advisable to use 
       google developer tools to check how your design looks on different devices. Keep calm, you can’t learn in
       one day.</p>
