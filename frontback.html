    <h2>FRONT END vs BACK END</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly front end and back end development differ a lot in terms of syntax
      and the way the things actually work, even though, they both are the part of website development, 
      a part of the same environment.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front end development is composed of design and programming languages. The principal
      design languages are html and css. Html is HyperText Markup Language and it is called a skeleton of the
      website. Css means Cascading Style Sheets and it is responsible of the colors, fonts, transitions, gradients
      and animations. As I mentioned above, Front End consists of programming language too, it is JavaScript. 
      Javascript can be very tricky, especially nowadays. There are many libraries and frameworks of Javascript
      which come out every day, each of them is more complicated and it requires a strong Javascript background.
      The examples of those frameworks are React created by Facebook and Angularjs made by Google. 
      The lighter version of Javascript is jquery. Jquery is Javascript but with much shorter syntax. 
      Jquery is really amazing because you can write with it a simple function just in a few lines instead of
      multiple which it is a case when you use a raw JavaScript.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back end development is totally different than Front End. There are no design languages
      in it, and you use mainly one back end language and its frameworks, depends of your company preferences.
      Commonly known back end languages are php, python, javascript and nodejs, java. You can even do back end
      development with C languages but the most popular are php and its framework laravel etc, python and django
      etc, or mean stack - mongodb, expressjs, angularjs, nodejs. In order to work with mean stack you need to
      know Javascript well since all of the above technologies are based on it.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do Front End and Back End look? If you are Front End developer you are responsible
      for small details of the website like single popup animations, parallel columns, straight layout, typography,
      user interface and experience. You have to be ready for spending a long hours just to polish one small element
      on the website and make sure it is nicely composed with the other elements. It can be a bit annoying but this
      is the job of Front End Developer. Also, front end is changing very rapidly and you need to be ready to update
      your knowledge. If you think that knowing jquery and Javascript is enough, you’re wrong. In order to get a job
      nowadays you need to have in your resume React or Angularjs.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of working with Back End - it is completely different world. Back end is based 
      on variables, controllers, databases. There is also security involved, testing and overall hosting of the
      website lay on your shoulders. You are focusing mainly on taking out specific data from database upon user’s
      request (click on the button). Click on the button - hover effect - the button changes color from black to
      red - Front End Development. Click on the button - the user submits the email through contact form on your
      website - information goes viral straight to database - Back End Development.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In simpler words, everything what is visible on the website belongs to Front End 
      development. Everything behind the curtain is Back End development. You should try both and see which
      one is more appalling to you.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you probably ask yourself - which one is better? Well, the answer depends on your
      own preference. Front end is definitely time consuming and the perspective of spending hours just to make
      that simple animation work is daunting. Back end doesn’t bother about details, the things must work in
      general and all needed information must be pull out of database upon request. Apart of that, the information
      must be secured! Think about all the money that can disappear from someone’s account if your back end code
      will fail - it can hurt...Nevertheless, don’t worry - once you will be writing the programs for banks, 
      you will be actually working with thousands of other developers trained in security, so the blame will
      be shared within the team.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front End and Back End terms both create the term commonly known as the Full Stack Web
      Development. If you want to read more about the term - check out the next post.</p>
