    <h2>THE FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read my previous posts, you probably already know what is the Full Stack Web Development. 
       If you didn’t, then it is a good time to learn about this term in more details.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Full Stack Web Development is both Front End and Back End development. As the Full Stack
       Web Developer you are responsible for an overall project. You know both front end and back end languages. 
       Front End languages are html5, css3, javascript. Back End languages are php, python, java, ruby. You are 
       flexible to pick up back end languages, if you work as freelancer. If you work for the company - you will
       have to use technologies of your boss preferences.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Full Stack Development worth to learn? Of course, it is! In many cases, it depends
       of the job you want to get it. If you do freelance, you need to be the Full Stack Web Developer. You will
       do all the things by yourself because, so be ready to be totally independent. If you aim for the company, 
       you will most likely work either as Front End developer or Back End developer alas you will work for a 
       small company or a startup where the budget is limited and the management can afford only to have one 
       person hired instead of two.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to become the Full Stack Developer, it is advisable to learn Front End 
       development first, but you can work as Back End developer without knowing front end! Learning Full Stack 
       Development takes a lot of time since you need to focus on many technologies. Also, you need to be ready 
       that you won’t be fully professional in all of them. It is impossible to do so alas you has been learning
       many years and you felt like you reached the proficiency. However, you need to be aware that every year 
       new frameworks are coming out especially front end frameworks. You need to keep up with them, and what if
       you also need to learn a new back end framework? These things happen very often, but don’t worry! Learning
       process is much easier with time, once you know one programming language - learning the second one is much
       easier, you just need to get to know the new syntax.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average salary of the Full Stack Developer in the United States of America is minus/plus
       90k a year. It is a great salary and you definitely want to make that money! Don’t be afraid of the Full 
       Stack Development, you can learn it and become an excellent developer.</p>
