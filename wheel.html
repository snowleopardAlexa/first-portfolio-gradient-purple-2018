    <h2>DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first rule which must be known to anyone who just has started learning web development
       or any kind of programming is: DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL. What does it exactly mean? The answer 
       is clear - use TOOLS: frameworks, code snippets, code libraries, models and ready solutions.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aspiring web developer you need to know programming languages in order to keep up with 
       rapidly growing and changing technology. The languages you must know are obviously html5, css3, 
       javascript and its libraries like ajax, jquery or its frameworks like angular and react, php 
       and its frameworks, python and its frameworks, java, ruby and its….HOLD ON! So many technologies! 
       Really?! Do you really need to learn all of them in order to develop your first website? NOPE!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web development is a broad field. It’s composed of Front End development and Back End development. 
       Front End developers work with html, css, javascript and their frameworks. Back End developers work
       with php, python, java, ruby and their frameworks. When it comes to Back End development, 
       you are free to choose a language you would like to use it. It can be very popular php and 
       laravel(framework) or python and django(framework as well), java or ruby.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to be Front End developer? Great! Learn html5, css3, javascript + libraries, frameworks.
       Do you want to be Back End developer? Awesome! Pick up either php or python. Do you want to be the 
       Full Stack Developer -  it means to work with both frontend and backend. That’s impressive! 
       Learn html5, css3, javascript + libraries and frameworks, php or python or java or ruby and their 
       frameworks.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am supposed to talk about different things here. As an aspiring web developer you need to know
       what reinventing the wheel means. It is like you had been given a wheel which was created a million years
       ago, but you don’t use it because you go with your own ideas… The wheel itself was made a long time ago
       and we use it to run our cars. It is great tool and there is no substitute for it. The same wheel we can
       find in programming world. This wheel or actually wheels are frameworks and libraries. Let me grab an
       example and explain the term further. For example - Bootstrap comes with many features and it is fully
       responsive. Wait… What does it mean responsive? RESPONSIVE means - the website looks good on any device,
       no matter if you use smartphone or tablet or stationary computer - it will look the same and always good.
       Try for an instance, to build a responsive website using only RAW html5 and CSS3. Your website gonna 
       crush pretty quickly and your code will never work, and even if it does work...
       Your website won’t be fully responsive… You need to be fast in development mode - delivering a 
       product is very important and you musn’t fool around with the raw code if you have ready 
       solutions in the forms of frameworks and libraries!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t fall for this scenario - you just has started to code… You are determined, you want to be good, 
      you want to learn, you push yourself to study hard from all these programming books... You want to write
      your own code because you want to be professional. You think that you don’t need or you just simply
      don’t want help. You think like using frameworks makes you less of a developer, and apart of that,
      this is a simple cheating, isn’t it? My advice - kill the voice of doubts in your head... 
      Don’t ask yourself the above questions. You are totally wrong.</p>   
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USE TOOLS - using a framework is not cheating and it won’t harm your skills. You need to understand 
      the principles of the language and know how to use it, but always use tools. They were designed for you
      to make your life easier. Actually, without frameworks, you can’t program effectively nowadays because
      you can’t deliver a product on time! Speaking about web development - we hadn’t had so many 
      devices before, so there were no frameworks to be used. We used rather raw languages and it was working.
      Nowadays, it is impossible to build a product without using a framework. You are developing MOBILE-FIRST
      websites and your goal is to make them look excellent on any device. This goal you can achieve only with
      a framework.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this industry, you will hear a lot the quote about reinventing the wheel. You will understand it 
      better once you’ll start to build the websites and write your own programs. Don’t waste your time and take
      seriously the above statement!</p>
